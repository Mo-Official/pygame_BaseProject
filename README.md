# Pygame Project Template
You are using a template made by Mouaz Tabboush for pygame projects.

You may use the Template for any project.

The Template is good but still not complete. If you have any ideas and want to contribute to the template, please feel free to message me.


## Running on Mac Os/ Linux
If you are using Mac Os or Linux you just enter `make run` in the terminal at the repo root to create a virtual env. install all dependancies and run the game.
If you want to remove the virtual env run `make clean`.
